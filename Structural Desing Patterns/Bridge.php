//Bridge pattern is interested with main class groups. By doing that it will be easy to use them under
//the same body and bridge interfaces with those classes.
//We created main messengar interface to implement other sub classes.
//After that we have generated another interface which takes the subclasses as argument
//Bridge interface implemented to set the subclass variables from the previous class schema
//This class is used for the subclasses that has the nearly same functionality.
// Methods used in these subclasses called from the subclasses on the above with the super classes inherited√ß
