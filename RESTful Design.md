# Representational State Transfer

- Stateless Nature
    1. Restful APIs are stateless. The state of a request should be transferred around rather than stored.
    2. Versioning will help you not to break client implementations. api version should be added version tag.
    3. Filtering a system by using a parameter query.
    4. Sorting with a parameter.
    5. Searching with a parameter that can be routed through a search service
    6. Field can be used to query for specific multiple fields.
